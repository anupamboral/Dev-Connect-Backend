//* first we have initialized the project using npm init.
//* Difference between package.json and package-lock.json
//*The package.json and package-lock.json files serve distinct but complementary roles in Node.js projects, primarily concerning dependency management.
//*package.json:
//*Purpose: Defines the project's metadata (e.g., name, version, description) and lists the project's direct dependencies along with acceptable version ranges (e.g., using caret ^ or tilde ~ symbols).
//*Content: Specifies high-level requirements for dependencies, allowing for minor or patch updates within a defined range.
//*Human Readability: Designed to be easily understood and modified by developers.
//*package-lock.json:
//*Purpose: Records the exact, resolved dependency tree, including the specific versions of all direct and transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies). It ensures reproducible builds across different environments.
//*Content: Contains precise version numbers, integrity hashes, and the exact location from which each package was installed.
//*Machine Readability: Primarily for use by npm or Yarn to guarantee consistent installations.
//*Automatic Generation: Automatically generated or updated by npm install or yarn install
//*In essence, package.json declares what dependencies your project needs and what range of versions are acceptable, while package-lock.json precisely records which exact versions of all dependencies were installed during the last successful npm install or yarn install. This ensures that anyone setting up the project gets the identical set of dependencies, preventing "it works on my machine" issues.

//* now we are going to create a server using express.js,it is open source framework of node js.
//* lets install express command - npm i express
//* now we have to require express inside a constant named express , this require("express") returns a function.
//* creating our server using express
const express = require("express"); //* this require("express") returns a function.
//* now we can call this express function and it will create a express js application
const app = express(); //* this function call returns the express js application, so here we are creating the instance of the express js application.
//* basically we are creating a web server using express js .

//* we need to handle the incoming requests and send them response.
//* So we need a request handler function , so here to handle requests we are going to use use() function.the first param is the path , if we don't mention the first param then the response will be same for all the paths, bt when we specify the path then the response will be only specific to the path mentioned
app.use("/home", (req, res) => {
  res.send("hello from home page"); //* on the response we can call the send method to actually send any response to the client/browser.
});
app.use("/test", (req, res) => {
  res.send("testing is good😉😉😉");
});
//* now using this web server we have to listen for incoming requests on some port , so any body can connect to us using that port.
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("server is listening successfully on port 3000");
}); //* using the listen method we listening to the incoming requests on port number 3000, the first parameter of this listen method is the port number , now there is second parameter which is a callback function, and this will be called when our server is up and running.

//* whenever we are making some change in our code we have to restart our server manually every time , so it is not updating the changes  automatically on the browser."nodemon" is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. So we can install a package called nodemon using the command
//* npm i -g nodemon. here -g is for install it on global/system level so we can use it in any project.
//* now to use nodemon , when we will start running our application using terminal, instead of 'node src/app.js',  we have to write "nodemon src/app.js".
//* let's save these scripts in our package.json file , for start script we will keep node src/app.js and for dev script we will keep nodemon src/app.js, then after doing this we just need to write the script like npm run dev to to run using nodemon and npm run start to run using node.
