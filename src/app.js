//* creating our server using express
const express = require("express"); //* this require("express") returns a function.
//* now we can call this express function and it will create a express js application
const app = express(); //* this function call returns the express js application, so here we are creating the instance of the express js application.
//* basically we are creating a web server using express js .

//? we can write multiple request handlers for the same path. To do that we can use a third parameter of the get method, which is another route handler function , if we don't send any response from the first handler, will it go to the second handler automatically?
//* No , the request will still hangout ,and not go to the the second handler
//* to send the request to the second handler , in the first handler function we have tpo mention another parameter , named "next", and call it inside the first handler, only then it will go to the second handler, this next is a function given by express.then only response 2 will be sent to postman/browser.

//? but what if we send the response from the first handler and below that also call the next() function, will it send 2 responses, will it go to the second handler?
//* first it will send the first response then because we we called the next()  function it will go to the second handler , and print the console.log but then when sending the second response it will throw an error, as javascript waits for none , so it started to execute the second handler because next() was called , but but when postman send request to our server a socket connection was made , and as soon as we sent the first response the socket connection was closed , that's why when our server will try to send the second response it will through an error that , the response has already sent. the error will be shown in the terminal - (Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client).

//? but what if in  the first handler first we call the next() and below that we we send the first response , then which handler's response will be returned because we  are retuning the response from the second handler also?
//* So to understand it we have to know how js code gets executed inside v8 engine's call stack, when js engine starts to execute the first handler it will first print the console log in our terminal, then in the next line it sees a next(), So a new function execution context will be created for second handler, and pushed on top of the first handler's function execution context , now second handler's code will start to execute line by line, so first console.log route handler2 will be printed then in the next line it will send the response - response 2 . then as the second handler's code is fully executed it will move out of the call stack and call stack comes back to the first handler's function execution context where it left( on next() function call) and starts the execution from the next line and it sees in the next line we are trying to send the first response,  but as the response is already sent while executing the second handler , so it will throw an error "Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client".

//* we can use as many route handlers as we want for a single path
//* next method is available for all of the http methods like - use(), get(), put(), post(), patch(), etc.
//* some more edge cases explained through below example
//? what if we have three route handlers , and from first and second route handler we have not sent any response and called next() in both , in the last handlers again we have not sent any response and again called next()?
//* in the postman , we will get an error "Cannot GET /profile", because in the last handler , when we are calling next() , express is expecting another route handlers after it , but we have not written any handler after the third handler, that's why , as it can not find the next route handler function after next() inside the third handler , it is returning us "Cannot GET /profile" error.
//* So express say , make as many route handlers you want to , but at the end the response should be sent, so if we create another route handler and return response from their it will word fine.
//* if in the third handler , we would not call the next() and also not returned the response then , the request will hang in the third handler , and no response would be sent, and after some time connection timeout would be shown in the postman/browser.
/*
app.use(
  "/profile",
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("route handler 1");
    next();
  },
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("route handler 2");
    next();
  },
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("route handler 3");
    next();
  }
);
*/
//* another way of writing multiple route handlers
//* we know in every http method , the first param is the path, then after that we can mention as many route handlers as we want , but another way is we can put all route handler functions inside one array and just mention that one array like below.
/*
app.get("/address", [
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("route handler 1");
    next();
  },
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("route handler 2");
    next();
  },
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("route handler 3");
    next();
  },
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("route handler 3");
    res.send("ye duniye hi abhi ka address haiðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰");
  },
]);
*/
//*even we can mix both , so in a single http method , we can use separate function and also a array of route handler functions, like below
/*
app.get(
  "/address",
  [
    (req, res, next) => {
      console.log("route handler 1");
      next();
    },
    (req, res, next) => {
      console.log("route handler 2");
      next();
    },
  ],
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("route handler 3");
    next();
  },
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("route handler 3");
    res.send("ye duniye hi abhi ka address haiðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰");
  }
);
*/
//* we can even create independent route handlers for the same path iit will work exactly same but remember order matters because js engine will run the code line by line one after another.
/*
app.get("/address", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("route handler 1");
  next();
});
app.get("/address", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("route handler 2");
  res.send("ye duniye hi abhi ka address haiðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰");
});
*/
//? but why do we need so many request handlers for a /path?
//* the reason is middleware
//*! Middleware
//* actually till this time, we were calling all the handler functions as request/route handler , but when we write multiple handler functions, and in the last handler we send the response , that specific handler which is sending the response is actually called the request handler or the route handler and the other handlers before it ,are called middleware.let's understand using an example. in the below example we have 4 handler for same /address path, so when a request comes and it matches the path it will go through 1st then 2nd then 3rd handler ane after another line by line and finally in the 4th handler it is sending the response, so the 4th handler is actually the route/request handler and the 1st,2nd, 3rd handlers are called middleware, so we a request comes to an express application it will check the matching path , then go through all middlewares and finally from the route handlers it sends the response. So these words middleware , route handler ,request handler are the lingo used in the industry , actually all these are just functions but developers use these words to explain concepts.
/*
app.get("/address", [
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("middleware 1");
    next();
  },
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("middleware 2");
    next();
  },
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("middleware 3");
    next();
  },
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("actual request/route  handler");
    res.send("Response :- ye duniye hi abhi ka address haiðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰");
  },
]);
*/
//*Tasks performed by middleware:
//*Execute any code.
//*Make changes to the request (req) and response (res) objects.
//*Call the next() middleware function to pass control to the next function in the stack. If next() is not called, the request will be left hanging unless the current middleware ends the response cycle.

//? lets see some use cases of having middleware:-
//* suppose we have we have two route handlers/apis for two paths very similar, like /admin/getUserData and /admin/deleteUserData.
//* as this is related to admin we have to verify/authenticate if the user is admin or not by verifying the token sent by the client's browser.
//* So we can write authentication check logic for both paths , but is it a good way to write the code for same thing twice? No , and that's where middleware come into picture, so instead of writing both like this
/*
app.get("/admin/getUserData", (req, res, next) => {
  //* admin auth checking
  console.log("admin auth is getting checked");

  const token = xyz; //*fake data , in real world token comes with the request.body
  const isAuthorized = token === "xyz";
  if (!isAuthorized) {
    res.status(401).send("Unauthorized request");
  } else {
    res.send("User data");
  }
});
app.get("/admin/deleteUserData", (req, res, next) => {
  //* admin auth checking
  console.log("admin auth is getting checked");

  const token = xyz; //*fake data , in real world token comes with the request.body
  const isAuthorized = token === "xyz";
  if (!isAuthorized) {
    res.status(401).send("Unauthorized request");
  } else {
    res.send("User is deleted");
  }
});
*/
//* see above we have written the same auth code twice for two handlers .
//*but if we use middleware then we don't need to do it ,see how below(we can use get() also  but normally to handle all kind of http methods we use use() but using get() i8s also fine)
//* as /admin is generic so it will be triggered for both /admin/getUserData and /admin/deleteUserData as the first portion is same, and here in this middleware we are only checking the auth and ut will check auth for both cases ,so we don;t need to write the same auth code twice, and if the auth is verifies then only the next() function will be called and it will move to actual route handler, unless it will send the response "Unauthorized request" with the status 401.
/*
app.use("/admin", (req, res, next) => {
  //* admin auth checking
  console.log("admin auth is getting checked");

  const token = xyz; //*fake data , in real world token comes with the request.body
  const isAuthorized = token === "xyz";
  if (!isAuthorized) {
    res.status(401).send("Unauthorized request");
  } else {
    next(); //*this will be only called if the auth is verified
  }
});
app.get("/admin/getUserData", (req, res, next) => {
  //* this route handlers will be only called when the auth is correct because of above middleware we written for auth.
  res.send("User data");
});
app.get("/admin/deleteUserData", (req, res, next) => {
  //* this route handlers will be only called when the auth is correct because of above middleware we written for auth.
  res.send("user is deleted");
});
*/
//* this is the simplest answer why we need middleware.
//? we can even use app.all() instead of app.use() both has subtle difference, we can learn that just search on google app.use() vs app.all().
//? and also learn about the https status codes.like 404, 200

//* and in the industry , they simplify it more , so they keep the middleware function inside another folder and require the middleware from their. like below -
const { adminAuth } = require("./middlewares/auth.js");
app.use("/admin", adminAuth);
app.get("/admin/getUserData", (req, res, next) => {
  //* this route handlers will be only called when the auth is correct because of above middleware we written for auth.
  res.send("User data");
});
app.get("/admin/deleteUserData", (req, res, next) => {
  //* this route handlers will be only called when the auth is correct because of above middleware we written for auth.
  res.send("user is deleted");
});
//* For admin we have two apis -getUserData,deleteUserData, so we did it like above, now suppose we also have to authenticate the user , and for the user we just have one api - user. So inside ./middlewares/auth.js , we can can create a middleware for user and require it here and use it like below:-

//* now using this web server we have to listen for incoming requests on some port , so any body can connect to us using that port.
const { userAuth } = require("./middlewares/auth.js");
app.get("/user", userAuth, (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("userData");
}); //* see how middleware can simplify our work and help to write clean code.as we can write multiple request handler inside  http methods, it makes our code more clean and easy to understand.
//* this also helpful when we have some api which does not need authentication,like if we have a sign up api, so if the user is signing up first time then we would not need any authentication, for that api, so we can easily right that without using the middleware and as the in the above user api , we need auth so we mentioned it internally,, so above middleware would not interact with this new signup api.
app.post("/user/signup", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("user is registered successfully");
});

//! handling errors
//* inside a route handler whenever we are making a database call we should always write that inside a try{}catch{} block.
//* but if there is still some unhandled error then we can catch them using another feature given to us by express, we have already seen if we write app.use("/") , then it will trigger for all the routes, so we can also use to handle errors, and express js has designed the this app.use() so much dynamically, that if we mention only two parameters it will treat first as request and second as response like this: -
//* app.use("/",(req,res)=>{})
//* if we mention only three parameters it will treat first as request and second as response and third as next like this: -
//* app.use("/",(req,res,next)=>{})
//*if we mention four parameters it will treat first as error and second as request , third as response and fourth as next like this: -
//* app.use("/",(err,req,res,next)=>{})
//* but here the order matters here, so if you are mentioning four parameters and always you have mention the err first ,unless suppose if you mention next as first and error as last then next will behave like error and error will behave like next , so be mindful.
//* so we use this app.use("/",(err,req,res,next)={}) to handle error gracefully, because if we don't do it then if any error happens in any of the routes than it can throw weird errors which can be understandable by us developes but not the client, like cart is defined , or it can expose the api urls etc.to test this we can create an api and throw a error using (throw new Error("error happened"))), so we will catch the error and we  will handle it like this
app.get("/userData", (req, res) => {
  throw new Error("error happened");
  res.send("user"); //* as we are throwing error above so this will not be executed and it will jum to next route handler , and below error handler will be triggered
});
app.use("/", (err, req, res, next) => {
  //* we can also log our error here so we can be notified
  if (err) res.status(500).send("Something went wrong");
}); //*and always heep this error handler below all apis/route handlers and use try catch blocks to catch errors, because route handlers are read line by line from top to bottom, so order always matters

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("server is listening successfully on port 3000");
}); //* using the listen method we listening to the incoming requests on port number 3000, the first parameter of this listen method is the port number , now there is second parameter which is a callback function, and this will be called when our server is up and running.
