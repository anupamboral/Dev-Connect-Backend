//* creating our server using express
const express = require("express"); //* this require("express") returns a function.
//* requiring  database.js file
const connectDb = require("./config/database");
//* now we can call this express function and it will create a express js application
const app = express(); //* this function call returns the express js application, so here we are creating the instance of the express js application.
//* basically we are creating a web server using express js .

//* importing the User model
const User = require("./models/user");

//! importance of express.json() middleware.
//* so to convert the json to js object , we will use a middleware given to us by express.js. and that's express.json(). this middleware can take the json from the req.body then convert that to js object then again put that inside the req.body and we can then easily access it form the request body.
//* to use it we can just put it inside app.use(express.json())) , like we cerate middlewares, as we know app.use() work for all methods when we specify any path as first arg, but if we don't even specify any path then it will work for all requests with any path . so that's why we are using it without any path so it can work for any api. like this :- app.use(express.json()))
//* we need to put this above other apis so what ever request comes with json data get converts to the js object and we can easily access the data inside the request handlers req.body.
app.use(express.json());

//* now we can create our apis to add a user into our database
//* now inside our app.js , we will create a api to create a user into our database, so we already know that if we want to create a user then post method is best for that because we want to create some new data/document inside the database.
app.post("/signup", async (req, res) => {
  //! accessing the request
  console.log(req.body);
  //!creating instance from User model using dynamic data coming from client side
  const user = new User(req.body);

  try {
    //! saving the user instance inside the database using .save() method
    await user.save();
    //! sending response to the client
    res.send("User added successfully");
  } catch (err) {
    //! catching errors and sending error message
    res.send(400).send(`Error saving the user:-${err.message}`);
  } //* status code 400 represents bad request , and we are using it here because we are sending request to the server to save the user data and if the request fails then we can use to 400 status code as it represents bad request.
});

connectDb()
  .then(() => {
    console.log("successfully connected to the database cluster");
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("server is listening successfully on port 3000");
    }); //* using the listen method we listening to the incoming requests on port number 3000, the first parameter of this listen method is the port number , now there is second parameter which is a callback function, and this will be called when our server is up and running.
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error("cannot connect to the database");
  });
