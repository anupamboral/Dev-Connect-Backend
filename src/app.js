//* creating our server using express
const express = require("express"); //* this require("express") returns a function.
//* now we can call this express function and it will create a express js application
const app = express(); //* this function call returns the express js application, so here we are creating the instance of the express js application.
//* basically we are creating a web server using express js .

//! this use() method will respond to all http methods
//! So we should never keep it on the top  because it will be triggered by any http method , so even if we use it we should it below of all other other methods.
// app.use("/user", (req, res) => {
//   res.send("testing is good😉😉😉");
// });

//* this get method will be only triggered by GET call
app.get("/user", (req, res) => {
  res.send("firstName:`anupam`,lastName:`boral`");
});

//*this post method will only respond to POST call
app.post("/user", (req, res) => {
  res.send("your data is saved inside the database");
});

//*this put method will only respond to PUT call
app.put("/user", (req, res) => {
  res.send("your full profile is updated");
});

//*this patch method will only respond to patch call
app.patch("/user", (req, res) => {
  res.send("you first name is updated");
});

//*this delete method will only respond to delete call
app.delete("/user", (req, res) => {
  res.send("your profile is deleted");
});

//* this use method will respond to all http methods(so always keep it below of other methods)
app.use("/test", (req, res) => {
  res.send("testing is good😉😉😉");
});

//* now using this web server we have to listen for incoming requests on some port , so any body can connect to us using that port.
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("server is listening successfully on port 3000");
}); //* using the listen method we listening to the incoming requests on port number 3000, the first parameter of this listen method is the port number , now there is second parameter which is a callback function, and this will be called when our server is up and running.
